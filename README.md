# OOP - Assignment1

This is my assignment for DT228/2 OOP Assignmnt 1.

It has:

4 Screens, an opening sreen including the PShape ship drawn in the middle of the canvas, which then is bounded by a circle with an arc, then some green coloured arc rotating around. It also has a radar map which is animated by two lines scanning across the radar, and two buttons which can switch to the ship detail UI and mission UI.

In the ship detail UI, it has another instance of the Ship and some details loaded from a csv file. Along the right side of the UI, it has a circle radar which simulates scanning enemies.

Then, on the mission UI, it has the map drawn which its data comes from another csv file, and it has the mission detail to allow user to enter the mission. The mission was not really up to point since the simulation UI is only a ship simulation.
